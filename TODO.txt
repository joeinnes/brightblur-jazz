# What's blocking MVP?
- [X] Deleting CoValues
  - MVP can launch with soft-delete/tombstoning.
- [ ] Request architecture ('request to view' and 'approve/reject' workflow)
  - I wonder if Inboxes can achieve this?
- [ ] 'Claiming profiles' and inviting by email
  - Requires a mechanism for discarding the default profile created on account creation.

# What's Next?
- [ ] Remove co_z from all the IDs that are user visible
- [ ] Single-use invitation links for particular images/FaceSlices
- [ ] Face suggestions: store labelled face descriptors in each user's root. Don't share these descriptors (or do?) and suggest recognised faces automatically. https://medium.com/@neerajvageele451/build-your-own-face-recognition-web-app-using-face-api-js-7982cd4a8bdb

# BrightBlur

BrightBlur is a photo-sharing app designed for communities. It allows users to upload and share photos, fostering a sense of belonging and interaction within a community. It uses on-device AI to blur faces and protect privacy of users, ensuring that only folks who have been approved as viewers can see the unblurred faces.

## Features

- **Photo Management**: Upload, view, and manage photos with ease.
- **Profile Access Control**: Admins can invite users and manage access permissions.
- **Community Engagement**: Participate in communities rather than a global stream.
- **Privacy Protection**: Blurs faces for privacy and security.
